# Intent

* Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

---

# Explanation

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) says:
> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

<br />

* In plain words:

* Enable the construction of components that are able to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing;

---

# Explanation

Four terms always associated with the pattern:

* Command
* Object that knows about the receiver and invokes a method of the receiver;

* Receiver
* Object that does the work;

* Invoker
* Knows how to execute a command, and optionally does the bookkeeping about the command execution;

* Client
* Decides which commands to execute at which points, passing the command object to the invoker object;

---

# Example

In our example, a Wizard can cast spells on targets.

* Spell will be the command (implements the Command interface);
* Devil (a Target object) will be the receiver;
* Wizard will be the invoker;
* App will be the client;

```

//App.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
Wizard wizard = new Wizard();
Devil devil = new Devil();
devil.printStatus(); 		//Devil, [size=normal] [visibility=visible]

wizard.castSpell(new ShrinkSpell(), devil);
wizard.castSpell(new InvisibilitySpell(), devil);

devil.printStatus(); 		//Devil, [size=small] [visibility=invisible]

wizard.undoLastSpell();

devil.printStatus(); 		//Devil, [size=small] [visibility=visible]

wizard.redoLastSpell();
devil.printStatus(); 		//Devil, [size=small] [visibility=invisible]
}
```

# Applicability

Use the Command pattern when you want to:

* Parameterize objects by an action to perform;
* You can express such parameterization in a procedural language with a callback function, that is, a function that's registered somewhere to be called at a later point;

* Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks;

<br />

* Specify, queue, and execute requests at different times;
* A Command object can have a lifetime independent of the original request;

* If the receiver of a request can be represented in an address space-independent way, then you can transfer a command object for the request to a different process and fulfill the request there;

---

# Applicability

Use the Command pattern when you want to:

* Support undo;
* The Command's execute() operation can store state for reversing its effects in the command itself;

* The Command interface must have an added unexecute() operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to execute;

* Executed commands are stored in a history list;

* Unlimited-level undo and redo is achieved by traversing this list backwards and forwards calling unexecute() and execute(), respectively;

---

# Applicability

Use the Command pattern when you want to:

* Support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash;
* By augmenting the Command interface with load() and store() operations, you can keep a persistent log of changes;

* Recovering from a crash involves reloading logged commands from disk and re-executing them with the execute operation;

---

# Applicability

Use the Command pattern when you want to:

* Structure a system around high-level operations build on primitive operations;
* Such a structure is common in information systems that support transactions;

* A transaction encapsulates a set of changes to data;

* The Command pattern offers a way to model transactions;

* Commands have a common interface, letting you invoke all transactions the same way;

* The pattern also makes it easy to extend the system with new transactions

---

# Use Cases

* To keep a history of requests;

* Implement callback functionality;

* Implement the undo functionality;
